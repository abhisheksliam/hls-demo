## Installation - Build / Usage 
    $ git clone https://github.com/abhisheksliam/hls-demo.git .
    $ npm install

    $ gulp

Build all source code files and fire a livereload server which serves the 
files in `dist/`. (Build files:  (https://github.com/abhisheksliam/hls-demo/tree/gh-pages))

 * **less**: Compile all `*.less` files in the `less/` folder into 
   `dist/css/style.css`
 * **scripts**: Concatenate and minify all `*.js` files in the `js/` directory into
   `dist/js/main.min.js`
 * **html**: Copy all html files from `src/` `to `dist/`

## Deploy to gh-pages

**Step 1 :**
Remove the dist directory from the projectâ€™s .gitignore file
Remove gh-pages branch if already exists: `git push origin --delete gh-pages`

**Step 2 :**
Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).
`git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"`

**Step 3:**
Use subtree push to send it to the gh-pages branch on GitHub.
`git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
